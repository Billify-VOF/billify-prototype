"""Value objects for the Billify domain model.

This module defines immutable value objects that encapsulate business concepts
and their validation rules. Value objects are immutable and represent concepts
that are equal based on their properties rather than identity.

Currently includes:

- UrgencyLevel: Represents invoice urgency levels based on due dates
    - Used for visual indicators in the UI (colors)
    - Calculated from days until due date
    - Supports manual override for special cases

- InvoiceStatus: Represents the payment status of an invoice
    - Tracks if an invoice is pending, paid, or overdue
    - Used in both domain logic and persistence
    - Provides human-readable display names for UI

Usage:
    from domain.models.value_objects import UrgencyLevel, InvoiceStatus

    # Calculate urgency from days
    urgency = UrgencyLevel.calculate_from_days(days_until_due)

    # Get display name and color for UI
    display = urgency.display_name  # e.g., "Critical"
    color = urgency.color_code     # e.g., "#FF0000"

    # Use with Django models
    choices = UrgencyLevel.choices()  # For model field choices

    its due date.

    Each urgency level has an associated:
    - db_value: Integer value stored in database (e.g., 1)
    - color_code: Hex color for UI display (e.g., "#8B0000")
    - day_range: Tuple of (min_days, max_days) for calculation
      (e.g., (None, -1))
    - display_name: Auto-generated from enum name using title()

    Naming Convention:
    - Enum members use UPPERCASE names with underscores for multiple words
    - Examples: OVERDUE, HIGH, VERY_HIGH, PAST_DUE
    - title() will convert underscores to spaces: PAST_DUE -> "Past Due"
    - This ensures display_name generates clean UI labels
