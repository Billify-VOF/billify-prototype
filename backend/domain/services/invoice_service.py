"""This module contains the domain service for invoices. It encapsulates business
logic related to invoices, ensures adherence to domain rules, and enforces
invariants for invoice operations. It contains no references to infrastructure
or application-specific concerns.

This service contains pure domain logic related to invoices,
independent of infrastructure concerns like storage or data transformation.

NOTE: Currently this service mixes some domain, infrastructure, and application 
layer concerns. This is a known technical debt that should be refactored 
post-MVP to better adhere to clean architecture principles. The current 
implementation was kept due to time constraints for the MVP release.
