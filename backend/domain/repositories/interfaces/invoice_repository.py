"""Invoice repository interface for data access operations.

This module defines the abstract interface for invoice data access operations
using Python's ABC (Abstract Base Class). The interface serves as a contract
that all concrete repository implementations must follow.

Key concepts:
    - ABC (Abstract Base Class): Defines an interface that cannot be
      instantiated directly
    - @abstractmethod: Marks methods that MUST be implemented by any
      concrete repository class
    - Repository Pattern: Separates domain logic from data access
      implementation details

Example:
    # Concrete implementation must implement all abstract methods
    class PostgresInvoiceRepository(InvoiceRepository):
        def save(self, invoice: Invoice, user_id: int) -> Invoice:
            # Implementation specific to PostgreSQL
            pass
"""

from infrastructure.django.models.invoice import Invoice as DjangoInvoice  # Import the Django model


class InvoiceRepository(ABC):
    """Interface defining invoice data access operations.

    This abstract base class serves as a contract for invoice persistence
    operations. Any concrete implementation (e.g., Django ORM, SQLAlchemy,
    etc.) must implement all methods marked with @abstractmethod.

    The Repository pattern used here:
    1. Separates domain logic from data access details
    2. Makes the system more maintainable and testable
    3. Allows swapping different storage implementations without changing
       domain code
    4. Follows the Dependency Inversion Principle (SOLID)

    Example:
        class DjangoInvoiceRepository(InvoiceRepository):
            def save(self, invoice: Invoice, user_id: int) -> Invoice:
                # Django ORM specific implementation
