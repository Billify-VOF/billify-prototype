    Abstract interface for file storage operations.
    
    This repository defines the contract for storing and retrieving files,
    independent of the actual storage implementation (filesystem, cloud, etc.).
    
    The interface is designed to be:
    1. Storage-agnostic (works with any storage backend)
    2. File-type agnostic (can store any type of file)
    3. Focused purely on storage operations
