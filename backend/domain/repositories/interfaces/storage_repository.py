    Abstract interface for file storage operations.

    This repository defines the contract for storing and retrieving files,
    independent of the actual storage implementation (filesystem, cloud, etc.).

    The interface is designed to be:
    1. Storage-agnostic (works with any storage backend)
    2. File-type agnostic (can store any type of file)
    3. Focused purely on storage operations

    @abstractmethod
    def move_file(self, source_identifier: str, target_identifier: str) -> str:
        """
        Move a file from one location to another within the storage system.

        This operation should be atomic and implemented efficiently by the
        storage backend when possible (e.g., rename rather than copy+delete).

        Concurrency guarantees:
        - Atomicity: The operation should appear as a single indivisible action from the
          perspective of other processes/threads. Implementations should ensure that:
            * Within a single filesystem: Use native rename operations where available
            * Across different storage systems: Either complete entirely or not at all
            * On failure: No partial state should be visible (either old or new location exists)
        - Visibility: Upon successful return, the file should be accessible at the new location
          and completely unavailable at the old location
        - Implementation note: Some storage systems may not support true atomic moves across
          different volumes or storage types. In these cases, implementers should document
          any limitations and potential race conditions.

        Args:
            source_identifier: The identifier of the source file
            target_identifier: The identifier to use for the target location

        Returns:
            str: New storage identifier for the moved file

        Raises:
            StorageError: If file cannot be moved
