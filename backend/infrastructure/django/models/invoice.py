    """Database model for storing invoice information.

    This model handles the persistence of invoice data extracted from PDF
    files. It focuses on data integrity and storage, while business logic
    is handled in the domain model.

    Attributes:
        id (AutoField): Primary key, automatically added by Django.
                     Auto-incrementing integer field that uniquely
                     identifies each invoice.
        invoice_number (CharField): Business-specific unique identifier
        amount (DecimalField): Total invoice amount
        due_date (DateField): When payment is due
        status (CharField): Current payment status
        uploaded_by (ForeignKey): User who uploaded the invoice
        created_at (DateTimeField): When the record was created
        updated_at (DateTimeField): When the record was last modified

    Key Assumptions:
        - Invoices can only be created from PDF files
        - Maximum invoice amount is 99,999,999.99
        - Invoice numbers are unique but format varies by country
        - Status transitions are managed by the domain model
        - Timestamps are automatically managed by Django
