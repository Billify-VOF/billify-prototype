# Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer implements technical details and interfaces defined by the domain layer. This layer is responsible for all external concerns such as databases, file systems, and third-party services.

## Structure

### Django Implementation (`django/`)
Framework-specific implementations:
- `models/` - Django ORM models
  - `invoice.py` - Invoice data persistence model
  - `cash_flow.py` - Cash flow data model (planned)
- `repositories/` - Repository implementations
  - `invoice_repository.py` - Django ORM-based invoice repository
  - `cash_flow_repository.py` - Cash flow repository (planned)

### Storage (`storage/`)
File and object storage implementations:
- `file_system.py` - Local file system operations
  - PDF file handling
  - Temporary file management
  - File system abstractions
- `object_storage.py` - Cloud storage operations
  - S3-compatible storage
  - File upload/download
  - Access control

### Database
- Migrations (`migrations/`) - Database schema changes
- Connection management
- Transaction handling

## Technical Details

### Storage Implementation
- Local development: File system storage
- Production: S3-compatible object storage
- Automatic fallback mechanisms
- Configurable storage backends

### Database Implementation
- PostgreSQL with Django ORM
- Migration management
- Connection pooling
- Efficient querying

### File Processing
- PDF file handling
- Image processing
- Temporary storage
- Cleanup routines

## Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Implement interfaces defined in domain layer
- Keep technical details isolated from business logic
- Use dependency injection
- Follow repository pattern

### Error Handling
- Translate infrastructure errors to domain exceptions
- Implement proper cleanup in error cases
- Log technical details
- Maintain audit trail

### Performance
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Optimize database queries
- Handle large files efficiently
- Monitor resource usage

### Security
- Implement access controls
- Validate file types
- Sanitize user input
- Follow security best practices

## Best Practices

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep infrastructure code isolated
2. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on domain interfaces
3. **Configuration**: Use environment variables for settings
4. **Error Handling**: Proper cleanup and logging
5. **Testing**: Mock external services in tests

## Development Guidelines

- Use appropriate design patterns for implementations
- Document technical decisions and configurations
- Write integration tests for infrastructure code
- Monitor and log infrastructure operations
- Keep security considerations in mind
