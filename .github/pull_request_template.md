## Important Note on Migrations
⚠️ **DO NOT include migration files when creating a PR to the staging branch**

To prevent conflicts on the production server:
- Do not include migration files when submitting your PR
- Migration files should only be added directly to the staging branch
- Migration files should NOT be added to .gitignore

## Description
<!-- Provide a brief, clear description of what this PR accomplishes -->

## Change Narrative
<!-- This section is REQUIRED. Tell the story of your changes in detail to make reviewing easier -->
<!-- Include the following details: -->
<!-- 1. The problem you're solving and why -->
<!-- 2. Your overall approach and architectural decisions -->
<!-- 3. How the code works step-by-step (the "story" of execution) -->
<!-- 4. Alternatives you considered and why they were rejected -->
<!-- 5. Any technical debt or follow-up work created -->
<!-- 6. Document ALL decisions made during development (architecture, code, operations, library choices, trade-offs) in an ADR in the docs/ folder -->

## Type of Change
<!-- Mark with an 'x' all that apply -->
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change that fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change that adds functionality)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes)

## Code Quality
### Type Checking
<!-- Indicate if your code includes type checking -->
- [ ] TypeScript (frontend): Properly typed with interfaces/types for all components, functions, and variables
- [ ] Python (backend): Includes type hints for function parameters and return values
- [ ] No type hints/checks included (please explain why): 

### Documentation
<!-- Verify your code is properly documented -->
- [ ] All functions/methods have descriptive docstrings
- [ ] Every module, function, method, and class has a docstring that clearly explains its purpose and usage
- [ ] Docstrings follow the project's standard format
- [ ] Module-level documentation explains the purpose and usage of the component

## Domain-Driven Design (Backend)
<!-- For backend changes, verify alignment with DDD principles -->
### Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- [ ] Domain layer contains only business logic with no external dependencies
- [ ] Application services orchestrate use cases without containing business rules
- [ ] Infrastructure layer handles all technical and external concerns with no business logic

### Domain Layer
- [ ] Business concepts are properly modeled as entities, value objects, or aggregates
- [ ] Entities have identity and lifecycle
- [ ] Value objects are immutable and represent concepts with no identity
- [ ] Aggregates enforce consistency boundaries and invariants
- [ ] Domain events used for cross-aggregate communication
- [ ] Rich domain models with behavior, not anemic data containers

### Application Layer
- [ ] Orchestrates domain objects to implement use cases without containing domain rules
- [ ] Provides a stable API for user interfaces and external systems
- [ ] Manages transactions and coordinates work across multiple domain objects
- [ ] Handles authorization and permission checks
- [ ] Translates between domain objects and application DTOs when needed
- [ ] Contains application services that are thin and focused on specific use cases
- [ ] Application-specific exceptions are properly handled and translated
- [ ] Uses dependency injection to access infrastructure services

### Infrastructure Layer
- [ ] Infrastructure layer properly separates technical concerns from domain logic
- [ ] Implements interfaces defined in the domain layer (e.g., repositories, services, event handlers)
- [ ] Handles all external system interactions (databases, message queues, external APIs, file systems)
- [ ] Contains data persistence implementations (ORM configurations, database migrations, query builders)
- [ ] Manages cross-cutting concerns (logging, security, caching, monitoring)
- [ ] Converts between domain objects and external data formats (DTOs, API responses)
- [ ] Infrastructure-specific exceptions are caught and translated to domain exceptions
- [ ] Technical details are encapsulated and not exposed to higher layers

### Repository Pattern
- [ ] Domain repositories handle persistence without exposing implementation details
- [ ] Repositories work with domain objects, not DTOs or ORM models
- [ ] Query objects or specifications used for complex queries
- [ ] N/A - This PR doesn't involve backend domain logic
