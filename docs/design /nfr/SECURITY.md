# Security requirements

## Authentication

### Core account management
- No MFA for MVP:
 - Focus on core functionality validation
 - Minimize adoption friction
 - Small initial user base (10-100 users)
 - Read-only financial data
 - No direct payment processing
 - Third-party integrations handle sensitive access

- Email verification required:
 - Enable password reset notifications
 - Prevent fake accounts
 - Validate contact info

- Unique usernames/emails required
- Limited admin access to Billify team accounts

### Password requirements
- NIST guidelines:
 - 8+ character minimum
 - All ASCII characters supported
 - No composition rules
 - Prevent common weak passwords

- User experience:
 - Allow copy/paste
 - Show password option
 - No forced expiration
 - No security questions
 - Clear error messages
 - Clear requirements feedback

### Password storage 
- Industry-standard password hashing:
 - Protect against database compromise
 - Meet basic security requirements
 - GDPR compliance

### Session management
- 60-minute inactivity timeout
- Session invalidation on password change
- One active session per user

### Rate limiting
- Login attempts:
 - 5 failed attempts/5 minutes = block
 - 30-minute automatic unblock
- Password resets:
 - 3 requests/hour per email
 - Clear retry timing feedback

### Account recovery
- Secure password reset flow
- 1-hour email reset tokens
- Admin unblock capability

### Security monitoring
- 30-day authentication log retention
- Track:
 - Failed logins
 - Password changes
 - Reset requests
 - Admin actions

### API authentication
- Secure frontend-backend communication
- Integration failure handling:
 - Failure logging
 - User notification
 - Recovery guidance

## Data encryption

### In transit
- Let's Encrypt SSL certificates:
 - Secure HTTPS communication
 - Free and automated
- TLS 1.3 for APIs
- HSTS enabled
- Encrypted object storage transmission

### At rest
- PostgreSQL built-in encryption
- Restricted object storage access
- Secure application logs:
 - Admin-only access
 - No sensitive data logging
- Isolated configuration files
- Encrypted backups
- Secure data deletion:
 - Account deletion
 - Document removal

## Access control

### Role-based access
- Two roles:
 - Standard user: Own data only
 - Admin: System management access
- Standard user access limited to:
 - Company financial data
 - Invoice management
 - Integration settings

## Auditing

### Activity logging
- Track key events:
 - Auth attempts
 - Financial modifications
 - Integration syncs
 - Account changes
- Log entry requirements:
 - Timestamp
 - User ID
 - Action
 - Event details

### Log management
- 30-day retention
- Separate storage from application data
- Digital Ocean logging integration

### Admin alerts
Required for:
- Multiple failed logins
- Integration failures
- Critical system errors
