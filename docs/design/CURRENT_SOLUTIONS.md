# Current solutions & pain points

## Pain points of current solutions

1. Current solutions are difficult to use and require accounting knowledge.

2. Having an accurate view of the current, real-time cash flow position is time consuming and prone to error, because:
   * Invoices are stored in many different places, and a users' financial data is fragmented across different tools and services.
   * Tracking cash flow requires manually updating data between those different tools and services.
