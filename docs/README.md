# Billify Documentation

Welcome to the Billify documentation. This central knowledge base serves as your comprehensive guide to understanding, using, and contributing to our cash flow management system. Whether you're a developer looking to contribute code, an integrator wanting to connect with our APIs, or a team member seeking to understand our system architecture, you'll find the information you need here.

## Documentation Organization

We have organized our documentation into three main sections, each serving a specific purpose and audience.

### Architecture Documentation

The architecture documentation, found in `/docs/architecture/`, provides a deep dive into the technical foundation of Billify. Here you'll find detailed explanations of:

Our system's underlying architecture, including how different components interact and why we made specific design choices.

Process flows that illustrate how key system operations work, such as invoice processing and data synchronization.

Comprehensive diagrams that visualize complex system interactions and data flows, helping you understand both the big picture and the details.

Technical decisions and their rationales, helping you understand not just what we built, but why we built it that way.

### API Documentation

The API documentation in `/docs/api/` serves as your guide to integrating with Billify. It includes:

Detailed descriptions of all API endpoints, including their purposes, parameters, and response formats.

Authentication and authorization guides that explain how to securely connect to our services.

Real-world examples showing how to implement common integration patterns.

Best practices for efficient and reliable API usage.

### Development Documentation

In `/docs/development/`, you'll find everything needed to start developing with Billify:

Step-by-step guides for setting up your development environment.

Our coding standards and guidelines that ensure consistency across the codebase.

Testing procedures that maintain our high quality standards.

Deployment processes for different environments.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Billify, we recommend following this learning path:

1\. Begin with our architecture overview (`/docs/architecture/overview.md`) to understand our system's foundation.

2\. Review key process flows (`/docs/architecture/flows/`) to see how different parts of the system work together.

3\. Set up your development environment using our development guides (`/docs/development/`).

4\. Explore specific areas of interest in more detail.

## Contributing to Documentation

Documentation is a crucial part of our project, and we maintain it with the same care as our code. When contributing to the documentation:

Keep content up-to-date with code changes to prevent confusion and maintain accuracy.

Follow our established Markdown formatting for consistency.

Include practical examples that help readers understand complex concepts.

Add diagrams when they can help explain complex processes or relationships.

Test all code examples to ensure they work as described.

## Getting Help

We want to ensure you can find the information you need. If you need assistance:

First, try searching the documentation using key terms related to your question.

Check existing GitHub issues to see if your question has been addressed.

If you can't find an answer, open a new issue with a clear description of what you're trying to understand.

For urgent matters, contact the development team directly.

## Documentation Updates

Our documentation evolves with our software. We regularly:

Update content to reflect new features and changes.

Improve explanations based on user feedback.

Add new examples and use cases.

Enhance diagrams and visual aids.
