## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation about Billify's system architecture and design decisions. Our architecture documentation serves as both a reference and a guide for understanding how Billify works at a technical level.

## Directory Structure

```

### Process Flows (`/flows/`)

- Invoice processing pipeline documentation
- Visual diagrams for each major flow

### System Diagrams (`/flows/diagrams/`)

- Process flowcharts in Mermaid format
- System architecture visualizations
- Component interaction diagrams
- Database schema representations

## Core Architecture

### Clean Architecture Design

Our system implements clean architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- Domain Layer: Core business logic and rules
- Application Layer: Use case implementations
- Interface Layer: UI and API endpoints
- Infrastructure Layer: External service integrations

### Microservices Readiness

Architecture designed for future microservices transition:

- Defined service boundaries
- Independent data stores
- Standardized interfaces
- Loose component coupling

### Security Architecture

Built-in security measures:

- Secure authentication and authorization
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Regular security assessments

## Technology Stack

```
Frontend:
- Next.js with React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

Backend:
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL

Infrastructure:
- Local filesystem (dev)
- S3-compatible storage (prod)
- Tesseract OCR with enhancements
```

## Getting Started

1. Read `overview.md` for high-level architecture
2. Review process flows in `/flows/`
3. Study component interactions
4. Examine integration patterns

## Contributing Guidelines

When making architectural changes:

- Update relevant documentation
- Include Mermaid diagrams
- Document design decisions
- Consider scalability impact
- Maintain clean architecture principles
