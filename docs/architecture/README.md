# Billify Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation about Billify's system architecture and design decisions. Our architecture documentation serves as both a reference and a guide for understanding how Billify works at a technical level.

## Directory Structure

### Flows

The `/flows` directory contains detailed documentation of key system processes:

- Invoice processing pipeline

- User authentication flows

- Integration synchronization processes

- Each flow includes both written documentation and visual diagrams

### Diagrams

Located in `/flows/diagrams/`, this directory contains our system diagrams in Mermaid format:

- Process flowcharts

- System architecture diagrams

- Component interaction diagrams

- Database schema visualizations

## Core Architectural Principles

Billify's architecture follows these key principles:

### Clean Architecture

Our system is built using clean architecture principles, separating concerns into:

- Domain layer (business logic)

- Application layer (use cases)

- Interface layer (UI/API)

- Infrastructure layer (external services)

### Microservices Preparation

While currently monolithic, our architecture is designed to be ready for future microservices:

- Clear service boundaries

- Well-defined interfaces

- Independent data stores

- Loose coupling between components

### Security First

Security is built into our architecture through:

- Secure authentication/authorization

- Data encryption

- Audit logging

- Regular security reviews

## Technology Stack

Our current technology stack includes:

- Frontend: Next.js with React

- Backend: Django with REST Framework

- Database: PostgreSQL

- File Storage: Local filesystem (production: S3-compatible)

- OCR Processing: Tesseract with custom enhancements

## Understanding the Architecture

To best understand Billify's architecture:

1\. Start with the overview.md file

2\. Review the key process flows

3\. Examine the component interactions

4\. Study the integration patterns

## Contributing to Architecture

When contributing architectural changes:

1\. Update relevant documentation

2\. Include clear diagrams

3\. Explain design decisions

4\. Consider scalability implications
