## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation about Billify's system architecture and design decisions. Our architecture documentation serves as both a reference and a guide for understanding how Billify works at a technical level.

## Directory structure

```

├── flows/                # Key system process documentation
│   └── diagrams/       # System diagrams (Mermaid format)
└── overview.md         # High-level architecture overview
```

### Process flows (`/flows/`)

- Invoice processing pipeline documentation
- Visual diagrams for each major flow

### System diagrams (`/flows/diagrams/`)

- Process flowcharts in Mermaid format
- System architecture visualizations
- Component interaction diagrams
- Database schema representations

## Core architecture

### Clean architecture design

Our system implements clean architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- Domain layer: Core business logic and rules
- Application layer: Use case implementations
- Interface layer: UI and API endpoints
- Infrastructure layer: External service integrations

### Microservices readiness

Architecture designed for future microservices transition:

- Defined service boundaries
- Independent data stores
- Standardized interfaces
- Loose component coupling

### Security architecture

Built-in security measures:

- Secure authentication and authorization
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Regular security assessments

## Technology stack

```
Frontend:
- Next.js with React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

Backend:
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL

Infrastructure:
- Local filesystem (dev)
- S3-compatible storage (prod)
- Tesseract OCR with enhancements
```

## Getting started

1. Read `overview.md` for high-level architecture
2. Review process flows in `/flows/`
3. Study component interactions
4. Examine integration patterns

## Contributing guidelines

When making architectural changes:

- Update relevant documentation
- Include Mermaid diagrams
- Document design decisions
- Consider scalability impact
- Maintain clean architecture principles
