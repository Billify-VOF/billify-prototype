## Introduction

Billify is a modern cash flow management system designed for small to medium-sized enterprises. This document provides a high-level overview of Billify's architecture and explains how our components work together to deliver core functionality.

## System Components

### Frontend Architecture

```
Technology Stack:
- Next.js 14.2+ with App Router
- React 18.3+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching
- Radix UI and Shadcn/UI components
```

Key features:
- Server-side rendering for performance
- Component-based architecture
- State management via React hooks and React Query
- Modern UI with Shadcn/UI components

### Backend Architecture

```
Technology Stack:
- Django 5.0+ with REST Framework
- PostgreSQL 15+
- drf-spectacular for API docs
- django-filter for query filtering
```

Design principles:
- RESTful API design
- Domain-driven design (implemented in domain/ layer)
- Clean architecture patterns
- Separation of concerns across layers

### Integration Layer

Core integrations:
- Tesseract OCR for document processing
- S3-compatible storage for files (MinIO/AWS S3)
- Third-party service connectors
- CORS-enabled API endpoints

## Core Workflows

### Invoice Processing Pipeline

1. Document upload and validation
2. OCR processing and text extraction (via Tesseract)
3. Data structuring and validation
4. Database storage and indexing
5. UI state updates via React Query

### Authentication Flow

Current implementation:
- Session-based authentication
- Basic authentication support
- Development mode: AllowAny permissions
- CORS configuration for frontend access

### Data Management

Storage strategy:
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- S3-compatible storage for documents
- File-based session storage
- Local filesystem for development

## Architecture Principles

### Scalability

Built for growth:
- Stateless components where possible
- Efficient resource usage
- Optimized database queries

### Security

Security measures:
- Session-based authentication
- CORS protection
- Request validation
- Environment-based security settings

### Maintainability

Quality assurance:
- Automated testing (Jest, pytest)
- Consistent coding standards (enforced by ESLint, Black)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Regular code reviews

## System Integration

### Internal Communication

- RESTful APIs for data operations
- React Query for state management
- Session-based authentication
- Database access via Django ORM

### External Services

Current integrations:
- OCR processing via Tesseract
- S3-compatible storage
- Future planned: Banking APIs
- Future planned: Accounting software

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy

```
Testing Layers:
- Unit tests: Jest (frontend), pytest (backend)
- Integration tests: pytest
- E2E tests: Cypress
- API tests: drf-spectacular
```

### Development Process

```
Development Flow:
1. Local development
2. Automated testing
3. Code review
4. Integration
```

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Enhancements

Short-term:
- JWT authentication implementation
- Role-based access control
- Redis for caching
- WebSocket for real-time updates

Long-term:
- Machine learning for document processing
- Microservices transition
- Enhanced caching strategy
- Automated workflow builder

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for Billify's current operations. The codebase follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns, making it maintainable and extensible for future enhancements.
