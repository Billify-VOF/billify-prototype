# Billify Architecture Overview

## Introduction

Billify is designed as a modern, scalable cash flow management system that helps small to medium-sized enterprises track and manage their financial flows. This document provides a comprehensive overview of Billify's architecture, explaining how different components work together to deliver our core functionality.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

Our frontend is built with Next.js and React, providing:

- Server-side rendering for optimal performance

- Component-based UI architecture

- State management using React hooks

- Real-time updates where needed

### Backend Architecture

The backend uses Django with a focus on:

- RESTful API design

- Domain-driven design principles

- Clean architecture patterns

- Scalable data processing

### Integration Architecture

Our integration layer handles:

- OCR processing for invoices

- Third-party service connections

- Data synchronization

- Error handling and recovery

## Core Components

### Invoice Processing System

The invoice processing pipeline is a key component that:

1\. Receives uploaded documents

2\. Processes them through OCR

3\. Extracts relevant data

4\. Stores structured information

5\. Updates the user interface

### User Management

The user system handles:

- Authentication and authorization

- User preferences

- Access control

- Session management

### Data Storage

Our data storage strategy includes:
