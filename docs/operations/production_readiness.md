# Production readiness guide

This guide outlines the key areas to consider for production deployment. 

## Performance and scalability

### Caching strategy
Why: For MVP, caching isn't an immediate concern as our data volume and user base are small. However, we've identified areas where caching would be beneficial as we scale:

1. Dashboard calculations and aggregations
   - These involve complex queries across multiple tables (invoices, transactions, cash flows)
   - Results don't need to be real-time (minute-level freshness is acceptable)
   - Same calculations are frequently requested by users viewing dashboards

2. Integration responses (especially for rate-limited APIs)
   - Both Yuki and Ponto have API rate limits
   - Data doesn't change frequently (e.g., invoice status might change once per day)
   - Caching would help stay within rate limits while maintaining responsiveness

3. Session management (when we have more concurrent users)
   - Reduces database load for frequent session lookups
   - Improves response time for authenticated requests
   - Better handling of concurrent user sessions

Note: Redis implementation and query caching will be evaluated based on actual performance metrics and user growth. The decision to implement caching will be driven by:
- Measured response times for dashboard queries
- API rate limit encounters
- Number of concurrent users

### Deployment strategy
Why: For MVP, we're starting with a simple deployment on a single server. Containerization would provide these benefits when needed:

1. Consistent environments
   - Package application with exact dependency versions
   - Ensure development and production use identical setups
   - Example: New developer joins the team, runs one command, and gets the exact same Python, Django, and database versions as production. No more "it works on my machine" problems

2. Deployment reliability
   - Test new versions in isolation before switching
   - Quick rollbacks if something goes wrong
   - Example: If we deploy a bad update, we can instantly switch back to the previous working version instead of trying to manually undo changes

3. Resource management
   - Isolate application components from each other
   - Set clear resource limits per component
   - Example: Background invoice processing job can't crash the web server by using too much memory, as it's limited to its own container

Note: While containers offer these benefits, complex orchestration (like Kubernetes) would be overkill for our current scale. We'll revisit when we have specific needs like:
- Running multiple application copies during end-of-month peak usage
- Separating web servers from background jobs for independent scaling
- Automatically adding more capacity during busy periods

## Reliability and monitoring

### System observability
Why: For MVP, we need basic monitoring to ensure the service is running properly and to understand usage patterns

Current focus:
- Basic error tracking (Django error logging)
  Example: When a user gets a 500 error trying to view an invoice, we can see the exact error and which API call failed
- Server health monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
  Example: If the server starts running out of disk space due to log files, we get notified before it becomes critical
- Integration status (Yuki/Ponto connectivity)
  Example: If Yuki's API becomes unresponsive, we know immediately rather than waiting for user complaints

Future needs (based on growth):
- Detailed performance metrics
  Example: Understanding which dashboard queries are slowest and for which customers
- User behavior analytics
  Example: Seeing that most users check their cash flow first thing Monday morning, so we should pre-cache those calculations
- Advanced error correlation
  Example: Connecting a failed invoice sync with a previous API timeout to identify patterns

### Data protection
Why: Even at MVP scale, we need to ensure financial data is safe and recoverable

Current requirements:
- Regular database backups
  Example: If a user accidentally deletes important invoices, we can restore them from last night's backup
- Secure storage of credentials
  Example: Even if someone got access to our database, they couldn't read the stored API keys for Yuki/Ponto
- Basic error logging
  Example: When a sync fails, we log which invoices weren't processed so we can retry them

Future considerations:
- Automated backup testing
  Example: Regularly trying to restore a backup to ensure we can actually recover data when needed
- Multi-region backups
  Example: Keeping copies of backups in different locations in case of data center issues
- Advanced disaster recovery
  Example: Being able to switch to a backup server within minutes if our main server fails

Note: High availability features like failover capabilities will be considered when we have evidence of their need based on:
- Actual uptime requirements from customers
  Example: Companies that need access to their financial data 24/7 for international operations
- Impact of downtime on business operations
  Example: If a 1-hour outage during business hours would significantly impact our customers' operations
- Cost-benefit analysis of implementation
  Example: When the cost of implementing failover becomes less than the potential cost of downtime

## Security and compliance

### Current security measures
Why: Even at MVP scale, we need to protect sensitive financial data and API access

Currently implemented:
- Basic authentication (Django's auth system)
  Example: Users must log in to access any financial data
  Example: Failed login attempts are rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks
  Example: Passwords are properly hashed using Django's password hasher
- OAuth2 for integrations
  Example: We use OAuth2 tokens for Yuki/Ponto, never storing raw credentials
  Example: Tokens are automatically refreshed before they expire
  Example: If a token is compromised, users can revoke access from their Yuki/Ponto dashboard
- HTTPS everywhere
  Example: All data transmission is encrypted, including API calls
  Example: We enforce HTTPS by redirecting HTTP to HTTPS
  Example: We use up-to-date TLS protocols and cipher suites

### Security roadmap
Why: We'll need additional security measures as we handle more sensitive data and users

Next priorities:
- Enhanced logging
  Example: Tracking who viewed which invoices and when
  Example: Logging all changes to financial data with the user who made them
  Example: Recording failed API calls with full context for debugging
- Session security improvements
  Example: Automatic logout after 30 minutes of inactivity
  Example: Invalidating sessions when users change their password
  Example: Limiting to one active session per user
- Regular security reviews
  Example: Monthly review of access logs and user permissions
  Example: Checking for unusual patterns like access from new IP addresses
  Example: Reviewing integration token usage and refreshes

Future considerations (when needed):
- Advanced authentication options
  Example: When customers request 2FA for additional security
  Example: SMS or authenticator app verification for sensitive operations
  Example: IP-based access restrictions for enterprise customers
- Comprehensive audit logging
  Example: When we need to track all data modifications for compliance
  Example: Recording before/after values for all financial data changes
  Example: Maintaining an immutable audit trail for regulatory requirements
- Automated security monitoring
  Example: When we need to detect unusual access patterns
  Example: Alerting on multiple failed login attempts from same IP
  Example: Flagging unusual data access patterns (like downloading all invoices)

Note: Our security measures will evolve based on:
- Customer requirements (especially for larger companies)
  Example: A customer needs SOC 2 compliance for their audit requirements
  Example: Enterprise customers requiring specific security certifications
  Example: Customers in regulated industries needing specific data handling
- Amount and sensitivity of data we're handling
  Example: When we start handling direct bank integration data
  Example: When we store historical financial records beyond 12 months
  Example: When we process personal financial information
- Regulatory requirements as we expand
  Example: GDPR compliance when we expand to EU customers
  Example: Financial regulations in new markets
  Example: Industry-specific compliance requirements
