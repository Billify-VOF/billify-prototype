# Enterprise deployment considerations

This document explains why enterprise deployments need additional features beyond our MVP setup.

## High availability
Why: Large companies can't afford system downtime
- Example: A company loses money every minute they can't process invoices
- Example: International customers need access 24/7 across time zones
- Solution: Multiple servers in different locations that can take over if one fails

## Security requirements
Why: Enterprise data breaches are extremely costly
- Example: Financial data of hundreds of companies could be exposed
- Example: Compliance auditors require specific security measures
- Solution: Advanced security features like 2FA, audit logs, and intrusion detection

## Custom integrations
Why: Large companies often use specialized software
- Example: Company uses SAP instead of Yuki
- Example: Custom ERP system needs special data format
- Solution: Build custom integration adapters for their systems

## Monitoring and alerts
Why: Problems must be found before users report them
- Example: Slow invoice processing affecting multiple customers
- Example: Integration with bank is failing silently
- Solution: Advanced monitoring and automatic alerts

## Backup and recovery
Why: Enterprise data loss is not acceptable
- Example: Accidental deletion of year-end financial records
- Example: Database corruption during peak usage
- Solution: Multiple backup locations and quick recovery procedures

## Performance at scale
Why: Enterprise usage patterns are more demanding
- Example: Hundreds of users checking dashboards each morning
- Example: End-of-month processing of thousands of invoices
- Solution: Caching, read replicas, and resource scaling
