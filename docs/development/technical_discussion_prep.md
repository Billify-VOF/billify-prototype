# Technical discussion preparation

## 1. Core architecture & design decisions

### 1.1 Domain-driven design approach

#### Why we chose DDD [Implemented - [ADR](billify-prototype/docs/development/decisions/domain_vs_django_models.md)]
- Clear separation between business logic and infrastructure [Implemented - [domain/models/](backend/domain/models/)]
- Business rules expressed in domain language [Implemented - [domain/models/](backend/domain/models/)]
- Easier onboarding for new developers [Implemented - [docs/development/concepts/domain_modeling.md](docs/development/concepts/domain_modeling.md)]
- Future-proof for business requirement changes [Ongoing - [ADR](../decisions/domain_vs_django_models.md)]

#### Key benefits
- **Maintainability**: Business logic changes don't affect persistence [Implemented - [domain/models/invoice.py](backend/domain/models/invoice.py)]
- **Testability**: Domain logic can be tested in isolation [Partially Implemented - [tests/domain/](backend/tests/domain/) - More test coverage needed]
- **Clarity**: Business concepts are explicit and centralized [Implemented - [domain/models/](backend/domain/models/)]
- **Flexibility**: Can change infrastructure without touching business rules [Implemented - [infrastructure/django/repositories/](backend/infrastructure/django/repositories/)]

#### Example: Invoice urgency implementation [Implemented]
- Domain concept: Business rules determine urgency [Implemented - [domain/models/value_objects.py](backend/domain/models/value_objects.py)]
- Infrastructure: Stored as integer in database [Implemented - [infrastructure/django/models/invoice.py](backend/infrastructure/django/models/invoice.py)]
- Benefits: Business rules can evolve without database changes [Implemented - See implementation above]
- Future extensibility: Easy to add new urgency rules [Implemented - [domain/models/value_objects.py](backend/domain/models/value_objects.py)]

Implementation example: [Implemented]```python
# Domain model (domain/models/invoice.py)
class Invoice:
    def calculate_urgency(self) -> UrgencyLevel:
        if self.manual_urgency:
            return UrgencyLevel(self.manual_urgency)
        days_until_due = (self.due_date - date.today()).days
        return UrgencyLevel.calculate_from_days(days_until_due)

# Infrastructure model (infrastructure/django/models/invoice.py)
class Invoice(models.Model):
    URGENCY_LEVELS = [
        (1, 'Overdue'),
        (2, 'Critical'),
        (3, 'High'),
        (4, 'Medium'),
        (5, 'Low'),
    ]
    manual_urgency = models.IntegerField(
        choices=URGENCY_LEVELS,
        null=True,
        blank=True,
        help_text="Manual override for invoice urgency."
    )
```

### 1.2 Database Choice (PostgreSQL vs MongoDB)

#### Why PostgreSQL [Implemented - [ADR](../decisions/database_choice.md)]
- ACID compliance crucial for financial data [Implemented - [infrastructure/django/models/](backend/infrastructure/django/models/)]

### 4.8 Mock Interview Scenarios [Implemented - [MOCK_INTERVIEWS.md](docs/development/MOCK_INTERVIEWS.md)]

#### Technical Decision Deep Dives [Implemented - [TECH_DECISIONS_QA.md](docs/development/TECH_DECISIONS_QA.md)]

##### Batch vs Event-Driven Architecture
Q: "Why did you choose batch processing instead of an event-driven architecture for syncing financial data?"

A: Our initial goal was to provide real-time cash flow visibility without introducing unnecessary complexity. While an event-driven approach might seem ideal, we determined that a batch sync every 30-60 seconds provides a great balance between freshness and simplicity.

Key points to reference:
- Technical trade-offs [Implemented - [TRADE_OFFS.md](docs/development/decisions/TRADE_OFFS.md)]:
  - Event-driven complexities (message queues, logging)
  - Simpler debugging with batch approach
  - Resource efficiency considerations
- Business perspective [Implemented - [BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/requirements/BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md)]:
  - SME needs analysis
  - Cost-benefit trade-offs
  - Reliability priorities
- Scalability path [Implemented - [SCALING_STRATEGY.md](docs/operations/SCALING_STRATEGY.md)]:
  - Clear transition strategy
  - Defined scaling triggers
  - Resource planning

Supporting example:
"For instance, Yuki's API has rate limits that make real-time sync difficult at scale. A batch sync respects these constraints while keeping our architecture manageable."

##### Production Scaling Scenarios
Q: "What would you change if Billify scaled to 10,000 users?"

A: At MVP scale (10-100 users), our Django monolith with PostgreSQL is efficient. But for 10,000 users, we'd need significant optimizations:

A: Let's break this down into key areas:

1. Database Scaling [Analysis Only - [DB_SCALING.md](docs/operations/DB_SCALING.md)]:
   - Read replicas for reporting
   - Partitioning by tenant
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization

2. Application Scaling:
   - Redis caching layer
   - CDN for static assets
   - Load balancer configuration
   - Session management

3. Processing Optimization:
   - Distributed task processing
   - Background job queues
   - Batch processing optimization
   - Resource allocation

4. Monitoring & Reliability:
   - Distributed tracing
   - Metrics collection
   - Alert thresholds
   - Failure recovery

Follow-up Q: "How would you ensure 99.99% uptime?"

A: High availability strategy [Analysis Only - [HIGH_AVAILABILITY.md](docs/operations/HIGH_AVAILABILITY.md)]:
1. Infrastructure:
   - Multi-zone deployment
   - Automated failover
   - Load balancing
   - Health checks

2. Data Reliability:
   - Regular backups
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Data replication
   - Consistency checks

3. Monitoring:
   - Proactive alerts
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - User impact analysis

#### Questions for Interviewer [Implemented - [QUESTIONS.md](docs/development/QUESTIONS.md)]

Strategic Questions:
1. Technical Challenges:
   - "What's the biggest technical challenge the team is facing?"
   - "How do you handle real-time processing at scale?"

2. Team Processes:
   - "How does the team approach technical debt?"
   - "What's your approach to knowledge sharing?"

3. Role Success:
   - "What would success look like in 6 months?"
   - "How does the team measure impact?" 

### 4.11 Code Examples & Technical Decisions [Implemented - [CODE_EXAMPLES.md](docs/development/CODE_EXAMPLES.md)]

#### Domain Model Implementation [Implemented - [domain/models/](backend/domain/models/)]

##### Value Objects vs Entities
Example: Invoice Status Implementation [Implemented - [domain/models/value_objects.py](backend/domain/models/value_objects.py)]

```python
# Value Object Pattern
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class InvoiceStatus:
    value: str
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.value not in ['draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'overdue']:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid status: {self.value}")
    
    @property
    def is_actionable(self) -> bool:
        return self.value in ['draft', 'overdue']
    
    @property
    def requires_attention(self) -> bool:
        return self.value == 'overdue'

# Entity Pattern
class Invoice:
    def __init__(self, invoice_id: UUID, status: InvoiceStatus):
        self._id = invoice_id
        self._status = status
        self._events = []  # Domain events
    
    def mark_as_paid(self, payment_date: date) -> None:
        if not self._status.is_actionable:
            raise DomainError("Invoice cannot be marked as paid in current status")
        
        self._status = InvoiceStatus('paid')
        self._events.append(InvoicePaidEvent(self._id, payment_date))
```

Trade-offs and Decisions:
1. Value Objects (InvoiceStatus):
   - Immutable by design (frozen=True)
   - Self-validating on creation
   - Rich domain behavior encapsulation
   - No identity (equality by value)

2. Entities (Invoice):
   - Has unique identity
   - Mutable state with invariants
   - Domain event tracking
   - Business rule enforcement

##### Repository Pattern Implementation [Implemented - [infrastructure/django/repositories/](backend/infrastructure/django/repositories/)]

Example: Invoice Repository [Implemented - [infrastructure/django/repositories/invoice.py](backend/infrastructure/django/repositories/invoice.py)]

```python
class DjangoInvoiceRepository(InvoiceRepository):
    def __init__(self, user_context: UserContext):
        self._user_context = user_context
    
    def save(self, invoice: DomainInvoice) -> None:
        try:
            with transaction.atomic():
                db_invoice = self._to_django(invoice)
                db_invoice.save()
                
                # Handle domain events
                for event in invoice.events:
                    self._handle_event(event)
        except IntegrityError as e:
            raise RepositoryError(f"Failed to save invoice: {e}")
    
    def _to_django(self, invoice: DomainInvoice) -> DjangoInvoice:
        return DjangoInvoice(
            id=invoice.id,
            status=invoice.status.value,
            amount=invoice.amount.value,
            currency=invoice.amount.currency,
            user_id=self._user_context.user_id
        )
    
    def _handle_event(self, event: DomainEvent) -> None:
        if isinstance(event, InvoicePaidEvent):
            # Update payment records
            PaymentRecord.objects.create(
                invoice_id=event.invoice_id,
                payment_date=event.payment_date
            )
```

Trade-offs and Decisions:
1. Repository Abstraction:
   - Hides persistence details
   - Transaction management
   - Domain event handling
   - Error translation

2. Data Mapping:
   - Explicit conversion methods
   - Domain model isolation
   - Infrastructure concerns separation

##### Service Layer Implementation [Implemented - [domain/services/](backend/domain/services/)]

Example: Invoice Service [Implemented - [domain/services/invoice_service.py](backend/domain/services/invoice_service.py)]

```python
class InvoiceService:
    def __init__(
        self,
        invoice_repository: InvoiceRepository,
        payment_service: PaymentService,
        notification_service: NotificationService
    ):
        self._invoice_repo = invoice_repository
        self._payment_service = payment_service
        self._notification_service = notification_service
    
    @transactional
    def process_payment(
        self,
        invoice_id: UUID,
        payment_amount: Money,
        payment_date: date
    ) -> None:
        invoice = self._invoice_repo.get_by_id(invoice_id)
        if not invoice:
            raise ApplicationError("Invoice not found")
        
        try:
            # Domain logic
            if not invoice.can_accept_payment(payment_amount):
                raise DomainError("Invalid payment amount")
            
            invoice.mark_as_paid(payment_date)
            
            # Infrastructure operations
            self._payment_service.record_payment(invoice_id, payment_amount)
            self._notification_service.notify_payment_received(invoice)
            
            # Persistence
            self._invoice_repo.save(invoice)
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Payment processing failed: {e}")
            raise ApplicationError("Failed to process payment")
```

Trade-offs and Decisions:
1. Service Composition:
   - Dependency injection
   - Service orchestration
   - Transaction management
   - Error handling strategy

2. Business Logic:
   - Domain model delegation
   - Infrastructure coordination
   - Cross-cutting concerns

##### Integration Layer Design [Implemented - [integrations/](backend/integrations/)]

Example: External Service Integration [Implemented - [integrations/providers/yuki.py](backend/integrations/providers/yuki.py)]

```python
class YukiIntegration(FinancialServiceProvider):
    def __init__(
        self,
        client: YukiClient,
        transformer: DataTransformer,
        error_handler: ErrorHandler
    ):
        self._client = client
        self._transformer = transformer
        self._error_handler = error_handler
        self._retry_policy = RetryPolicy(max_attempts=3)
    
    @retry_on_connection_error
    async def fetch_invoices(
        self,
        date_from: date,
        date_to: date
    ) -> List[Invoice]:
        try:
            raw_data = await self._client.get_invoices(
                from_date=date_from,
                to_date=date_to
            )
            
            return [
                self._transformer.to_domain_invoice(item)
                for item in raw_data
            ]
            
        except YukiApiError as e:
            self._error_handler.handle_integration_error(e)
            raise IntegrationError(f"Failed to fetch invoices: {e}")
        
        except TransformationError as e:
            self._error_handler.handle_data_error(e)
            raise IntegrationError(f"Failed to transform data: {e}")
```

Trade-offs and Decisions:
1. Integration Design:
   - Adapter pattern usage
   - Retry mechanism
   - Error handling strategy
   - Async operations

2. Data Transformation:
   - Separation of concerns
   - Domain model mapping
   - Error isolation

These examples demonstrate key architectural decisions and their implications:

1. Domain Model Integrity:
   - Value objects for immutable concepts
   - Entities for identity-based objects
   - Rich domain behavior
   - Invariant enforcement

2. Infrastructure Isolation:
   - Repository pattern for persistence
   - Clear boundary definitions
   - Transaction management
   - Error translation

3. Service Layer Organization:
   - Dependency injection
   - Operation orchestration
   - Cross-cutting concerns
   - Error handling

4. Integration Patterns:
   - External service adaptation
   - Data transformation
   - Error handling strategies
   - Retry policies

Would you like me to add more examples or elaborate on any particular aspect?
