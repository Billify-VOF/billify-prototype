# ADR: Monolithic vs microservices architecture for Billify MVP

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Billify needs an architectural approach that supports:
1. Core business requirements
   - Cash flow management platform for 10-100 initial users
   - Real-time integration with Yuki (accounting) and Ponto (banking)
   - Focus on MVP features

2. Team context
   - Small development team (2 developers)
   - Team handles both development and operations

3. Technical requirements
   - Rapid development and iteration capability
   - Future growth accommodation

## Decision
Implement Billify as a monolith for the MVP phase.

## Rationale

### 1. Development efficiency
- Single codebase simplifies development
- Faster implementation of core MVP features

### 2. Operational simplicity
- Single deployment unit reduces operational overhead
- Lower initial infrastructure costs

## Consequences

### Positive impact
1. MVP development
   - Faster time-to-market for core features

2. Operations
   - Reduced infrastructure complexity
   - Lower initial operational costs

3. Team efficiency
   - Matches current team size and capabilities
   - Reduced coordination overhead

### Growth limitations
1. Technical constraints
   - Application must be scaled as a complete unit
   - Available scaling options:
     a. Vertical scaling:
        - Adding more CPU/RAM to existing servers
        - Upgrading database server specifications
     b. Horizontal scaling:
        - Database replication (master-slave setup)
        - Read replicas for reporting queries
        - Load balancing across application instances
        - Caching layers (Redis/Memcached)
   - Deployment characteristics:
     - Coordinated deployments of entire application
     - Can use feature flags for controlled rollouts

## Migration triggers
Consider microservices when facing these specific challenges that can't be solved by scaling the monolith:

1. Business drivers
   - Need for independent deployment cycles for different features
   - Team growth requiring clear ownership boundaries
   - Regulatory requirements demanding strict service isolation

2. Technical indicators
   - Response time degradation
   - Database performance issues
   - Resource utilization alerts

## Preparation for future growth
1. Current implementation focus
   - Apply domain-driven design principles to core financial domains:
     - Invoice management
     - Cash flow tracking
     - Banking integration (Ponto)
     - Accounting integration (Yuki)
   - Maintain clear boundaries between these domains
   - Design clean interfaces for external integrations

2. Code organization
   - Organize codebase by business capability
   - Keep integration layers separate from core business logic
   - Maintain comprehensive test coverage for critical paths


3. Future flexibility
   - Clean separation of concerns in codebase structure:
     - `/domain`: Pure business logic, independent of frameworks
       - Models, repositories, and services isolated from infrastructure
       - Business rules and validation independent of delivery mechanism
     - `/integrations`: Isolated external service communication
       - Dedicated providers for Yuki and Ponto
       - Transformation layer separating external data formats
       - Sync strategies isolated from business logic
     - `/infrastructure`: Framework-specific implementations
       - Django models and repositories separate from domain
       - Database access patterns isolated from business logic
     - `/api`: Delivery mechanism isolated from core logic
       - REST endpoints separate from business rules
       - View logic isolated from domain operations

   This separation means:
   - External services can be replaced without touching business logic
   - Database technology could be changed without affecting domain code
   - New delivery mechanisms (GraphQL, gRPC) could be added easily
   - Individual components could be extracted if needed, with clear boundaries
